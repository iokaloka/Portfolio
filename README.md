# Portfolio by Jonathan Kähönen

Welcome to my very first online-portfolio!

In this repository I have and will release my personal programming projects.
I have added a separate folder for the source-codes of those projects, as well as a separate folder including screenshots of running programs.
Be informed, that so far every single released project is a work in progress. I also have a personal project of turning Twilight Imperium 4th edition by Fantasy Flight Games
into a software version, But I will retain from uploading anything copyright-protected here. I have uploaded screenshots of the program with blurred graphics.
The project is for my personal use only.


## About me
I am a 29 years old programming from Finland. I started programming as a hobby in 2014 when my room mate jokingly stated that "We should learn how to program".
in 2016 I applied and passed the exam to become a Computer science student at the University of Helsinki. Even though my studies have been stalled after the first year,
I have been practising and improving my skills through my own projects and small on-demand programs. My passion is video-game developement. Since I have been drawing and painting
through my whole life, I can easily draft well-enough graphics to support my game-developing progress. 14 years of playing guitar and some other instruments have also made it
possible for me to compose and record my own musical pieces for my projects. Since I have alvays been a good learner I believe that anything can be learned... But not everything.

## My competences


### Programming
1. Java has been my main languange ever since I started programming. To support this claim: Java programming 5/5, Advanced Java 5/5, Java demo-assignment 4/5 (Because I slacked in documenting).
2. Before Java I actually passed a Aalto-University course Scala-programming with a grade 5/5.
3. During my first year in school I got to know basics of Databases, SQL, HTML, Markdown, python, c, c++, JavaScript and ruby.


### Music
1. As I previously mentioned, I have played guitar for 14 years now. During that time I have also practised with Keyboard/piano and bass.
2. I got familiar with GarageBand and practised recording with it. This is how for exaple, Guilt Spawn theme song was created (In background of menu in Guilt Spawn v.0.2).
3. I have also played as a lead guitarist in 2 bands during 2008 - 2013 and recorded with both.


### Graphics
1. I have drawn and painted through my whole life. I am far from pro, but manage to draft characters, environments, situations, beasts and such.
2. I have begun my self studies regarding 3D-modeling with Blender.
3. Mostly my own projects have used 2D-graphics and I have managed with paint.net's layering features.
4. I also used to photograph during 2009 - 2011.
