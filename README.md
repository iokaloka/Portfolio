# Portfolio by Jonathan Kähönen

Welcome to my very first online-portfolio!

In this repository I have and will release my personal programming projects.
I have added a separate folder for the source codes of those projects, as well as a separate folder including screenshots of running programs.
Be informed, that so far every released project is under progress. I'm also working on turning Twilight Imperium 4th edition by Fantasy Flight Games
into a software version, but I will retain from uploading anything protected by copyright here. I have uploaded screenshots of the program with blurred graphics.
The project is for my personal use only.


## About me
I am 29 years old programmer from Finland. I started programming as a hobby in 2014 when my room mate jokingly stated that "We should learn how to program".
In 2016 I applied to university of Helsinki to become a Computer Science student and passed the exam. Even though my studies have been stalled after the first year,
I have been practising and improving my skills through my own projects and small on-demand programs. Videogame developement is my passion. Since I have been drawing and painting
through my whole life, I can easily draft decent graphics to support my game development. Fourteen years of playing the guitar and experience with some other instruments as well have made it
possible for me to compose and record my own musical pieces for my projects. Since I have alvays been a good learner I believe that anything can be learned... but not everything.

## My competences


### Programming
1. Java has been my main languange ever since I started programming. To support this claim: Java programming 5/5, Advanced Java 5/5, Java demo-assignment 4/5 (Because I slacked in documenting).
2. Before Java I actually passed a Aalto-University course Scala-programming with a grade 5/5.
3. During my first year at school I got to know the basics of Databases, SQL, HTML, Markdown, Python, c, c++, JavaScript and Ruby.


### Music
1. As I previously mentioned, I have played guitar for 14 years now. During that time I have also practised playing the Keyboard/piano and the bass.
2. I got familiar with GarageBand and practised recording with it. This is how for exaple, Guilt Spawn theme song was created (In background of menu in Guilt Spawn v.0.2).
3. I have also played as a lead guitarist in 2 bands during 2008 - 2013 and recorded with both.


### Graphics
1. I have drawn and painted through my whole life. I am far from pro, but manage to draft characters, environments, situations, beasts and such.
2. I have begun my self-studies regarding 3D-modeling with Blender.
3. Mostly my own projects have used 2D-graphics and I have managed with paint.net's layering features.
4. I have also done a lot of photographing during 2009 - 2011.
